# DI 502 Learning Resources

## Sprint 1 fundamentals

Most of you are new to at least some of these topics. By the **end of Sprint 1 (28/10)**, every team member should be able to do the following. Use the timeboxed learning spikes in Sprint 1 to close your gaps, and pair with a teammate who already knows the topic.

| Topic | You should be able to… | Suggested resource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Git & GitHub** | Clone a repository, create a branch, commit, push, open a pull request, review a teammate's pull request and resolve a merge conflict. | [*Pro Git*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (free online book), chapters 1–3. Prefer a guided course? Take DataCamp's [Introduction to Git](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-git), then [Intermediate Git](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-git) for branching and conflicts. |
| **Markdown** | Write headings, lists, tables, code blocks, links and GitHub note boxes (`> [!NOTE]`). | GitHub Docs: ["Basic writing and formatting syntax"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) (note boxes are under [Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts)) |
| **Scrum basics** | Explain the Scrum roles, events and artefacts, and the difference between a user story, a task and a spike. | Scrum.org ["What is Scrum?"](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module) and its [introductory video series](https://www.scrum.org/resources/introductory-video-series-scrum), and the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) |
| **Jira** | Create stories, spikes and sub-tasks, plan a sprint, move issues on the board and link issues to GitHub through Jira keys. | Coursera: [*Agile with Atlassian Jira*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-atlassian-jira) (Scrum module and lab). A shorter, non-technical option is Atlassian Community's [Get the most out of Jira](https://community.atlassian.com/learning/path/get-the-most-out-of-jira). |
| **LLM basics** | Explain what a token, a context window, a prompt and temperature are, and why LLMs hallucinate. Run a small open-source model in Colab. | Workshop material (14/10) |
| **Embeddings & vector search** | Explain what an embedding is and how similarity search finds relevant passages. | Workshop material (14/10) |
| **RAG** | Explain the indexing and query phases of a RAG pipeline and why RAG reduces hallucination. | [Lewis et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) and the lecture slides |
| **Prompt engineering** | Write a prompt that tells the model to answer only from the given passages and to say when it does not know. | Workshop material |
| **Evaluation basics** | Explain what an evaluation set is, why it must be fixed before experiments, and what "the gold article is in the top 5 results" measures. | Lecture slides: "Requirements, scope and acceptance criteria" |
| **Python environment** | Create a virtual environment, install packages and pin exact versions in `requirements.txt`. | Python documentation: ["venv"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) |
| **Chat interface** | Build a "hello world" chat app with Gradio's `ChatInterface`. | Gradio documentation: [ChatInterface guide](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast) |
